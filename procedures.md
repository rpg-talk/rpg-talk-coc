# Discord Etiquette

Discord is a public place and there are certain expectations for users when communicating here.

* Discord is for discussion. You can expect that other users will read, reply and provide feedback to what you say.
* Don't publicly send messages to blocked users. Blocked messages are one-way and this just promotes hostility.
* Try to complete your thought in a single message. Channel activity can mean that your message gets awkwardly segmented if you send your thoughts in fragments.

# Moderator Action

Please either message a moderator or use the `@Moderator` tag to bring a conversation to a moderator’s attention if any user is making you uncomfortable or may be violating our Code of Conduct. Try to only use the `@Moderator` tag for urgent matters that need to be dealt with immediately. ‘Calling out' or conducting witch hunts against other users is not acceptable.

**RPG Talk has a three step system:** First a warning from a moderator, then a 24-hour ban and finally a permanent ban. However, we reserve the right to remove users that contribute to a hostile or unpleasant atmosphere even if they don't violate any of these rules.

* **When conversations are stopped,** we DM everyone involved to clarify rules violations, dole out warnings. We will mention this in the applicable channel.
* **When we ban people temporarily,** we'll mention it in the applicable channel.
* **When we ban people permanently,** we will mention it in #announcements

# Emotions

The #emotional_support channel is a space with extra rules and protections pinned in the channel. Violating our code of conduct in this safe space may result in the mods skipping the typical 3-step system. Take extra care to respect others in this channel.
