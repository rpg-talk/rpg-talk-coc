## Channel System

We have **numerous channels that are hidden when you first join to keep your channels list short and simple**. Channel topics span from specific RPG systems to general things like game mastering to things completely unrelated to the server's original purpose.  

**Joining channels is managed by our @Robot** . You can use the robot by directly messaging him or by typing messages into any channel in RPG Talk. In order to receive messages from the bot, you will need to allow DMs from accounts on the same server as you. 

* **For help** with the channels, type `/help` 
* **For a list of channels,** type `/channels` 

* If you'd like to **join a channel** titled "dungeons_and_dragons", type `/join dungeons_and_dragons`

## Adding pronouns to your nickname

Adding pronouns to your nickname isn't a requirement but is is encouraged. To do this, click the server name "RPG Talk" in the left pane, select "Change Nickname." Then add whatever pronouns you'd like. Most people put them in parenthesis.
